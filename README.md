# Silas Kivisia Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website created for the PLP Academy July 2025 Hackathon 1: Portfolio Challenge.

The portfolio is built using only HTML and CSS (vanilla code). It includes the following sections:

- **About Me**: A brief introduction about who I am, my passion, and what drives me.
- **Programming Languages**: A list of languages I have experience with.
- **Education**: Details about my academic background and a downloadable CV.
- **Interests**: My interests in tech and what excites me about the industry.
- **Projects**: A few sample projects Iâ€™ve worked on, with brief descriptions.
- **Contact Form**: A simple form for anyone who wants to get in touch.

This project helped me practice structuring a full website using clean HTML and CSS, and also allowed me to reflect on my learning journey so far.

Thank you for viewing my project!
