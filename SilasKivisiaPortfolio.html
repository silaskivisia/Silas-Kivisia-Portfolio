<h2><p style="text-align:center;color:blue;"> Description </h2>
  <h5><p style="text-align:center;color:black;"> I am a dedicated and curious individual with a strong academic foundation in Library and Information Science, recently completing my degree in 2024 and awaiting graduation in 2025.<br>
My academic journey equipped me with essential knowledge in information management, digital systems, and web development using HTML.<br>
In addition to my studies, I have actively engaged in volunteer work, including cataloguing environmental materials at KENVO and supporting Bahá’í teaching efforts in rural Kenya.<br>
These experiences have shaped me into a thoughtful, organized, and dependable person who values service, growth, and innovation.<br>
I am currently developing my skills in software development, participating in hackathons, and building small projects to gain hands-on experience.<br> </h5>

<h2><p style="text-align:center;color:blue;"> Passion </h2>
   <h5><p style="text-align:center;color:black;"> My passion lies in using technology to solve real-world problems and bridge gaps in access to information and digital tools.<br>
I am especially drawn to web development, data organization, and creating simple, user-friendly digital solutions that can serve individuals, small businesses, and communities.<br>
Designing systems that make life easier—whether it's a website, an Excel tracker, or an online form—gives me great joy and purpose.<br>
I also enjoy learning about emerging tech trends and experimenting with new tools and platforms that help improve efficiency and communication.<br> </h5>

<h2><p style="text-align:center;color:blue;"> What Drives me </h2>
 <h5><p style="text-align:center;color:black;"> What drives me is the belief that technology, when used meaningfully, can uplift lives and create lasting impact.<br>
I’m motivated by the opportunity to grow my technical skills, contribute to purpose-driven projects, and collaborate with people who share the same hunger for learning and service.<br>
Challenges fuel my creativity and resilience, and I approach every project as a stepping stone toward becoming a capable, ethical, and impactful developer.<br>
My long-term goal is to build tools and systems that empower communities, support small businesses, and promote inclusive access to knowledge and opportunities.<br> </h5>

    <h2>Intrests</h2>
      <p>
    I’m deeply excited by the power of technology to transform lives, especially in communities where access to digital tools is limited. My interests lie in web development, digital systems, and creating solutions that make everyday tasks easier and more efficient. I enjoy learning how websites are structured and how different programming languages can work together to build interactive and accessible platforms.

    Professionally, I am drawn to roles that involve building user-friendly applications, managing digital content, and using data to drive smart decisions. I am also interested in tech for social good—using digital tools to support education, small businesses, and environmental efforts. The blend of creativity and logic in tech fascinates me, and I’m constantly looking for opportunities to grow my skills and apply them to real-world problems.
